            <h2>4. Free or Discounted Promotional Trials <a href="#top">↑</a></h2>
            <p>Your Marvel Unlimited Service subscription may start with a free or discounted promotional trial (each, a “Promotional Trial”). The time period (e.g., one week, one month, three months, etc.), restrictions and/or other terms and conditions of your Promotional Trial are as specified upon sign-up and/or in the specific promotional offer. Availability of any Promotional Trial is not guaranteed and, if one is available, is only available on the specific terms of the Promotional Trial then being offered. Except as otherwise expressly stated, Promotional Trials are not available to anyone who is an existing Marvel Unlimited account holder (including an account holder that received a Gift Membership) during the period during which the Promotional Trial is offered. Marvel reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine eligibility for any Promotional Trial offered in accordance with the applicable terms.</p>
            <p>Marvel may obtain a payment method from you upon you signing up for the Promotional Trial. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Promotional Trial offer, your first payment or un-discounted payment, as applicable, will be charged to your chosen payment method immediately following expiration of the Promotional Trial, and we will continue to bill your chosen payment method for the subscription fee on a recurring basis, unless you cancel in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. You can cancel your subscription at any time before the end of your Promotional Trial period. We provide notice of the terms of the Promotional Trial at the time you register and you may not receive a separate notice that your Promotional Trial is about to end or has ended, or that your paid subscription has begun. You can access details of your subscription, including the monthly or annual fee (as applicable) and end date of your Promotional Trial period and how to cancel via the <a href="/login">My Account</a> function, available to view by signing in on the Website.</p>
