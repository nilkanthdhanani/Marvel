            <p>Your subscription to the Marvel Unlimited Service includes enrollment into an ongoing and recurring payment plan. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the disclosed billing period for the same duration as the most recently completed billing period (e.g., one month, one year, or any other term then-offered by Marvel) and payment will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase and at the start of every new billing period, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation set forth below. You can cancel any time after you have signed up by following those instructions.</p>
            <p>Marvel reserves the right to change the pricing for the Marvel Unlimited Service or any part of any services Marvel makes available to you in any manner and at any time. In the event of a price change, we will attempt to notify you thirty (30) days in advance of the change by sending an email to the email address you have registered for your account. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with the instructions included in that email and in this MU Subscriber Agreement. If you do not cancel your subscription after the price change takes effect and prior to the start of your new billing period, your subscription will be renewed at the price in effect at the time of renewal, without any additional action by you, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for these amounts. We will not be able to notify you of any changes in applicable taxes. You are responsible for all third-party Internet access charges and taxes in connection with your use of the Marvel Unlimited Service. Please check with your Internet and/or mobile provider for information on possible Internet or mobile data usage charges.</p>
            <p>Except as otherwise required by law, for all automatically renewing subscriptions of less than one (1) year, you agree that Marvel is not obligated to send you any renewal or advance billing notices indicating that your credit card will be or has been charged.</p>
            <p>Except as otherwise required by law, for yearly automatically renewing subscriptions, you agree that Marvel is not obligated to send you any renewal or advance billing notices, other than one notice via e-mail, no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days before the end of the then-current annual subscription term.</p>
